# Get It Done To Do List

A to do list item object contains the following attributes:
+ listid : integer      The identifier of the to do list.  For this early version we only support a single list with listid=0.
+ itemid : integer      The identifier of the to do list item.  This value is unique across the entire application.
+ name : string         A textual name for the to do list item.
+ status : integer      Whether the item is complete (1)  or incomplete (0)

## Items Collection [/items]

### List All Items [GET]

The application currently only supports a single to do list, but in 
the future we will support multiple to do lists, and so this value 
will become more important later.

            {

                "name": "Buy milk",
                "status": 0

        ]
